          Whether it's the summer grass that tickles your feet or the red Bordeaux smacking on your palate,
           nearly every part of the world around you carnes special chemical markers These markers, called isotopes,
           can tell scientists where the molecules that compose a substance are from, where they traveled and what
            happened to them along the way But doing these analyses has been complex and costly Now, Stanford chemists
            have developed a new method to make isotopic analysis easier and less expensive

          BY CYNTHIA HAVEN L.A. Cicero Lindy Hop instruction Stanford is an epicenter for the vintage dance
           movement-but life in the Stanford dance world is not all foxtrots and tangos. The June 26-28 Stanford's
           Dance Weekend in Roble Gym offers something for modern dance enthusiasts, too: the hustle, the West Coast swing,
            1970s disco hustle, Bollywood and blues fusion.
