      I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department.
       Before coming to Stanford, I spent two years as a programmer at Taligent (now part of IBM).
       At Taligent, I worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product designed to improve communication
       and coordination within small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the Places for Project Teams product
       throughout an entire software lifecycle from initial product conception through the actual product branch.
    <br><br>
      I have a Ph.D from the University of California, Irvine, where I specialized in Software Engineering.
      My dissertation was on process support for software engineering teams. I also have a masters degree from Irvine,
      with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, and bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.
